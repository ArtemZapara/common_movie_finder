# Common Movie Finder
Streamlit Web Application to find common filmography of any two people on IMDB. When you provide names, the application will fetch a list of titles (movies or tv series) in which both persons appeared.

Preliminary data is taken from the open collection of IMDB datasets (https://datasets.imdbws.com/). In order to retrieve the up-to-date information from IMDB, we use Cinemagoer package (previosly known as IMDbPY). The project documentation is available at https://cinemagoer.readthedocs.io/.
